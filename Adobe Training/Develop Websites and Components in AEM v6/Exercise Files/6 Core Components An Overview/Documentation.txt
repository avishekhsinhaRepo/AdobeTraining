In Adobe Experience Manager, components are the structural elements that constitute the content of the pages being authored. Components have always been a fundamental element of the AEM experience, making page creation simple but powerful for the author and the development of components flexible and extensible for the developer.

Core Components were introduced to provide robust and extensible base components, built on the latest technology and best practices, and adhering to accessibility guidelines and are compliant with the WCAG 2.0 AA standard. Core components make page authoring more flexible and customizable, and extending them to offer custom functionality is simple for the developer.

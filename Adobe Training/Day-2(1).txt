Content Rendering(Sling Resource Resolution):
************************************************
Example:
************
http://localhost:4502/content/hello-world.html

Steps:
******
- The request will be intercepted by AEM
- AEM will forward the request to Sling:
		- Sling will again forward the request to "Sling Resource Resolver" (SRR):
				- Decomposition of the URL:
					- SRR will remove everything which pointing to the server address: /content/hello-world.html
					- SRR will then remove everything after the first "." towards the end of the remaining URL: /content/hello-world
				- SRR have validate the existance of the resource (/content/hello-world)
				- SRR has to find out resource renderer: "sling:resourceType"
						(training/components/content/quote)
					- i.) if SRR will get an absolute path: it wil directly reach up to the path
					- ii.)if SRR will get a relative path: 
										- /apps
										- /libs
				- The next thing is to identify the "Rendering Script":
						i.).<extension>--> .html
								- SRR will pick "Default Rendering Script" i.e., a script file that shares the same name as the name of the component
						ii.).<selector>.<extension>-->.red.html
								- SRR will pick an exact match to an existing script file name
						iii.).<selector>.<extension>-->.blue.html (if the selector doesnt exist)
								- SRR will start truncating selector from left hand side i.e., ".html"

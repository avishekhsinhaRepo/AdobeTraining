HTML Template Language (HTL):
*******************************
- This language was developed by Daysoft by the name "Sightly"
- it was not an opensource
- Originally developed to include dynamic behavior into web pages
- The idea was to replace JSPs
- Ease of use as compare to JSPs
- Secure as compare to JSPs
- HTL syntax can be used only with .html scrips and .jsp

Syntax:
***********
1. Expressions: to consume Objects exposed by AEM APIs
${.......}
	-->properties
	-->currentPage
	-->currentNode

2. Block Statements: to add additional logical attributes to your script
data-sly-<attibute>
			-->test
			-->include
			-->resource
			-->list
			
********************************************************
Templates:
***********
Types:
	- Static template (deprecated)
			- these types of templates will have to be developed from CRX using nodes/scripts
			- /apps/<project_folder/templates
	- Editable template
			- they are supported with touch optimized UI
			- /conf/<project_conf_folder>/settings/wcm/templates

Note: 
	template-type	--> templates	--> pages
	--: "template-type" is a template for a "template"
	-- template-type does not have a UI (touch optimized) support: (must be created from CRX)
			
<project_conf_folder>:
***************************
- Context Aware Configuration Folder


One doubt on previous answer (Proxy component should not be hidden)- Proxy components are anyways meant to be inherited by project specific components - which author will be using for authoring.. Why we need to expose those component
